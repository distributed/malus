Malus is a Kademlia style DHT written in Go. It should be RPC
compatible with kademlua, also hosted on github. This goal is partly
achieved. The implementation is very raw and as of 2010/1/21
incomplete. Please note that this is kind of a toy project of
mine. It's not like it could survive in a world full of NAT routers ;)
